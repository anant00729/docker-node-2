Crackling in my ears is the constant buzz from you. My life is all about you, It's just as you are switching on & off with no stability. It's surrounded by brief spells of darkness. Your chaotic flickering has embraced all my mess. My Illness which is a part of me also relates to you."

Yes, I solve no purpose. You remind me of the stream of mixed feelings that I always experienced. I do have kick starts and setbacks, all together at the same time. My current situation cripples me, makes me hate myself even more."

I'll be a survivor of this crippling disease. A crepuscular light will surely brighten my life again. I will grow in life. My strength will help me get out of this. I have learnt to acknowledge my feelings. I am overwhelmed to rise out of this. I won’t hide them anymore. They are mine and need to be spoken. I’ll care about what I wish to speak and not about what others want me to speak. No more pushing my thoughts under the carpet. It’s time to open the curtains and let them flow. Let them sweep out of my mind, and it is then when I’ll get my closure."

It’s high time I’ve been finding motivation from others; I’ll serve as my motivation from now. My internal circuit has been revived. No more fuses off. No more flickering. I’ll generate my energy. Memories of my old joyful moments will help me do so. I’ll lit up once again. And this time serve as a ray of hope for many other flickering light bulbs."
